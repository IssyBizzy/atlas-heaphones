WEBPAGE FROM SCRATCH

This project is a simple yet fully functional webpage built from scratch using HTML and CSS. It focuses on creating a clean, responsive design and ensures accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities. The goal of this project is to practice web development fundamentals while adhering to modern standards.

This project is designed to create a simple, static webpage with a focus on:

1. Semantic HTML: Writing HTML that is easy to read and understand, making the webpage accessible and improving SEO.

2. CSS Styling: Using CSS for styling and layout, with an emphasis on maintaining a clean and organized stylesheet.

3. Responsive Design: Ensuring the webpage looks great on a variety of devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screens.

4. Accessibility: Making the webpage usable for everyone, including people with disabilities, by adhering to accessibility best practices.

FEATURES

1. Responsive Layout: The webpage adjusts its layout based on the screen size of the device.

2. Accessible Navigation: Provides keyboard-friendly navigation and ARIA attributes.

3. Well-structured Content: Uses semantic HTML elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> for better content structure.

4. Custom CSS Styles: Custom styles for typography, buttons, forms, and more.

5. Cross-browser Compatibility: Tested in multiple browsers for a consistent experience.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. HTML5: For the structure and semantic markup of the webpage.

2. CSS3: For styling, layout, and responsive design (including media queries).

3. Responsive Design: Uses CSS media queries and flexbox/grid layout for responsiveness.

4. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications): For better screen reader support and accessibility enhancements.


DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

Building the HTML Structure:

Use semantic HTML5 elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>.
Ensure that content is logically structured for easy navigation.
Styling with CSS:

Define a consistent color palette and typography.
Use Flexbox and CSS Grid for creating flexible layouts.
Keep the stylesheet modular with reusable classes.
Adding Responsive Design:

Use media queries to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.
Test the webpage on various devices and screen resolutions to ensure responsiveness.

ENHANCING ACCESSIBILITY:

1. Add alt attributes to images for screen readers.

2. Use ARIA roles and labels for better screen reader support.

3. Ensure proper focus states for interactive elements like links and buttons.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN

This project uses a desktop-first approach, meaning styles are optimized for desktop devices first and adjusted for smaller screens using media queries. Some key breakpoints used are:

Mobile: Up to 480px
Tablet: 481px to 1024px
Desktop: 1025px and above
