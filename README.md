# DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

## Building the HTML Structure:

Use semantic HTML5 elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>.
Ensure that content is logically structured for easy navigation.
Styling with CSS:

Define a consistent color palette and typography.
Use Flexbox and CSS Grid for creating flexible layouts.
Keep the stylesheet modular with reusable classes.
Adding Responsive Design:

Use media queries to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.
Test the webpage on various devices and screen resolutions to ensure responsiveness.

## ENHANCING ACCESSIBILITY:

1. Add alt attributes to images for screen readers.

2. Use ARIA roles and labels for better screen reader support.

3. Ensure proper focus states for interactive elements like links and buttons.

## RESPONSIVE DESIGN

This project uses a desktop-first approach, meaning styles are optimized for desktop devices first and adjusted for smaller screens using media queries. Some key breakpoints used are:

Mobile: Up to 480px
Tablet: 481px to 1024px
Desktop: 1025px and above
